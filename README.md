ðŸ’Š Medicine Expiry Tracker

The Medicine Expiry Tracker is a Python-based mini project developed to help pharmacies manage their medicine stock efficiently. It allows admins to add medicines with details like name, price, expiry date, and quantity, which are stored in a CSV file for simplicity. The system automatically checks expiry dates, prevents the sale of expired medicines, and applies a 20% discount on medicines that are near expiry (within 30 days). Customers can view available medicines, purchase them safely, and receive alerts if stock is low or a medicine is nearing expiry. The project makes use of Pythonâ€™s datetime module for date handling and the colorama library for colored console outputs. With features like expiry tracking, discount handling, and role-based access (Admin and Customer), this project reduces wastage, ensures customer safety, and improves stock management. In the future, it can be expanded into a mobile or web application with advanced features like real-time notifications, barcode/QR code scanning, and detailed analytics for smarter pharmacy operations.
